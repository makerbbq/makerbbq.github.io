# RiverGrille Farmer's Charcoal Grill and Off-Set Smoker

This beautiful off-set smoker was a gift from my good friend Devlin Liles after he upgraded to a trailer mounted unit that he is now using.

There have been some modifications made to it though.

* The thermometer has been replaced, putting in an Old Country unit.
* Nomex has been applied around the door to the cookbox helping to seal in the heat.
* Latches have been installed to hold the cookbox door tightly shut.

With these changes, this smoker loses smoke in only three places:

1. The Chimney
1. The top of the Firebox
1. The Grease port, when the chimney is greatly dampered
