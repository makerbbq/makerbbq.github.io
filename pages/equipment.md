# Klose Backyard Chef (20 inches deep, 50 inch main chamber)

Oh, Craigslist, how I do love you sometimes.  I had been introduced to the amazing design of the pits created by David Klose from http://bbqpits.com and very much wanted one, but I did not want to pay full retail, which can be quite expensive.  So I started saving up my pennies and watching Craigslist for a deal.  Low and behold, a few months later, in the Houston area someone posted this Backyard Chef.  I had several photos, but still had a local friend actually set his eyes upon it, I also spoke with David Klose who graciously gave me his opinion about what the pit might be worth in its current state.  He was a stand up guy about it all, and I couldn't be happier with the quality of product I get off this great smoker.  I immediately adapted it to be able to use my Stoker Power Draft system and have been very happy with the results.

# Weber Smokey Mountain

There are few more iconic pieces of backyard equipment than the
[Weber Smokey Mountain][] or WSM.  We currently have the 18.5" diameter unit, though
we hope to add a 22.5" in the future.

We've modified the WSM with sensor grommets that allow us to pass through
thermometer wires without smashing them under the lid.  We've also added
a modification that allows us to remove the central smoker part of the body
and use it as a grill.

# Anova Precision Cooker

While we love BBQ, there are many other fine types of cooking.  The
[Anova Precision Cooker][] is a circulatory cooker which can be used for Sous Vide
cooking.

We added the Anova during a recent sale.  It allows some amazing options
and is now my favorite way to reheat BBQ.

# FoodSaver 2-In-1 Vacuum Sealing System

Sometimes you need to protect food from air or water, such as when you're
cooking Sous Vide, or to prevent freezer burn or dehydration as you
freeze or refridgerate food.  For this we use our [FoodSaver] to seal up
leftovers and prepare meats and vegetables for cooking in the
[Anova Precision Cooker][].

# Stoker Power Draft System

We use the Stoker system for temperature management in both our Klose
and our Weber.  I'm a huge fan, and have blogged about this system several
times.
