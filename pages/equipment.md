# RiverGrille Farmer's Charcoal Grill and Off-Set Smoker

This beautiful off-set smoker was a gift from my good friend Devlin Liles after he upgraded to a trailer mounted unit that he is now using.

There have been some modifications made to it though.

* The thermometer has been replaced, putting in an Old Country unit.
* Nomex has been applied around the door to the cookbox helping to seal in the heat.
* Latches have been installed to hold the cookbox door tightly shut.

With these changes, this smoker loses smoke in only three places:

1. The Chimney
1. The top of the Firebox
1. The Grease port, when the chimney is greatly dampered

# Weber Smokey Mountain

There are few more iconic pieces of backyard equipment than the
[Weber Smokey Mountain][] or WSM.  We currently have the 18.5" diameter unit, though
we hope to add a 22.5" in the future.

We've modified the WSM with sensor grommets that allow us to pass through
thermometer wires without smashing them under the lid.  We've also added
a modification that allows us to remove the central smoker part of the body
and use it as a grill.

# Anova Precision Cooker

While we love BBQ, there are many other fine types of cooking.  The
[Anova Precision Cooker][] is a circulatory cooker which can be used for Sous Vide
cooking.

We added the Anova during a recent sale.  It allows some amazing options
and is now my favorite way to reheat BBQ.

# FoodSaver 2-In-1 Vacuum Sealing System

Sometimes you need to protect food from air or water, such as when you're
cooking Sous Vide, or to prevent freezer burn or dehydration as you
freeze or refridgerate food.  For this we use our [FoodSaver] to seal up
leftovers and prepare meats and vegetables for cooking in the
[Anova Precision Cooker][].

# Stoker Power Draft System

We use the Stoker system for temperature management in both our RiverGrille
and our Weber.  I'm a huge fan, and have blogged about this system several
times.
