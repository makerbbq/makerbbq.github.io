# Low, Slow and Indirect

At the heart of it all, BBQ is about low temperatures (250°F - 275°F), applied
via indirect heat, and held steady for hours.  Any way which you can apply
this heat, and there are many, will produce BBQ.  Now, like anything else, there
are millions of ways to accomplish this, and we have our opinions here at [MakerBBQ][]
but anything can work.

# Fire

While there are many ways to create heat, our preferred way is via a wood fire.
You should research and use woods native to your region.  Why?  Sustainability,
cost, and much more.  We at [MakerBBQ][] use Oak as our primary wood.  We may mix
into this other woods like Mesquite, Pecan, Hickory or even Fruit Woods such as
Apple, Peach, or Cherry.

Why Oak?  It has a mild flavor, and relatively light smokey-ness.  Other woods can
be mixed in to add more flavor, but Oak is the source of heat.

# The Offset Smoker

Because we prefer wood fires, we tend to use Offset Smokers.  An offset smoker
has two chambers, a fire box and a cook box.  The fire box has a fire, which produces
smoke, which travels into the cook box and that indirect heat raises the temperature
of the cook box.

# The Meat

The meat can be anything you want.  Brisket, Tri-Tip, Chicken, Pork Ribs, Beef Ribs,
Rib Roast, or the like.  My suggestion, if you are new, is to start with Chicken.
Why? Because it cooks quickly, and the meat is cheap.  Brisket, the height of
good Texas BBQ, is awesome but with a cook time of about 1 hour per pound, it can
be 12-14 hours of cook time.  By comparison Chicken can cook in about 2 hours.
